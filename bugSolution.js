  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Bug Solution</h2>
  <p>The solution might involve adding more specificity to your CSS classes, carefully reviewing your media query breakpoints, ensuring you're using the latest version of Tailwind CSS, or debugging the class conflict using browser developer tools.  Here are some example solutions based on potential causes:

    * **Class Conflict:** Use the `!important` flag as a last resort (not generally recommended unless as a debugging step):  `.my-button { @apply bg-blue-500 !important; }`.  Alternatively, make your custom class more specific (e.g., using parent classes for context).
    * **Media Query Issue:** Double-check your breakpoints, using responsive design tools or browser debugging tools to see how the styles are applied at different viewport sizes.   Ensure your media query logic is correct and not conflicting with other media queries.
    * **Plugin Interaction:** Review the documentation of any plugins you're using and ensure there is no conflict between the plugin's styles and your custom styles.
